# 3 Things I <3 May 2018

[Project on Thimble](https://thimbleprojects.org/suncoastkids/507312/)

Based on project from [HourofCode.org](https://hourofcode.com/us).

## Language

HTML/CSS

## Location

Hosted at Agile Thought on May 21, 2018.

### What went well

The kids enjoyed having something they could immediately show off.
Taylor did a great job with the CSS animations.
Agile Thought provided a lot of snacks!

### Ways to improve

Personally, I wasn't feeling very good so I was not at my best, which I think affected it.  
We said it was intro to JS but then only did css/html (again my fault.)
