- [Week 1 Slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1jTQfuFdA1fytvmVetkgMpABw_P6RwDhSvDQD-pWFwEc/edit?usp=sharing)
- [Demo Project](https://july-2019-demo.glitch.me)

The students will tell a story using linked webpages for each portion of the story. They will use HTML to write their story on individual pages with a homepage featuring the list of characters with information about each character and a button to start reading the story.

## Language
HTML/CSS

## Location
SDG - 4 weeks - July 2019

## Plan
- *Week 1:* Create individual Glitch accounts, brainstorm story (characters, problem, etc.), give introduction to basic HTML tags(page structure, headings, paragraphs, and links), create homepage with content, and create interior pages with templated structure. Homework was to save six images on computer for next class.
- *Week 2:* Review HTML tags, give time to find images if needed, finish up homepage (introduce img tag), create interior pages, introduce inline styling and basic CSS (selectors, properties, etc.)
- *Week 3:* Remove inline styling, introduce stylesheets, classes, and IDs, implement styles
- *Week 4:* Introduce Google Fonts, FontAwesome, CSSGradient.io, and CSS animations, present projects

### What Went Well
- Glitch editor was easy for students to learn to use and doesn't require them to remember a password as you log in with an email address and a link sent to that address.

### Ways to Improve
- Request specific sdgjr email account to use for Glitch since the accounts require email validation to sign in rather than passwords.
