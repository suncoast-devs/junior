# Homework Excuse Generator October 2017

[Project on Thimble](https://thimble.mozilla.org/en-US/user/thrilla925/1223351/)

This is not an original SDG Jr project, it comes from <http://www.code.org> or <http://www.hourofcode.org>

## Location

Hosted at Gooee, 2 separate nights/classes.

### What went well

Someone else planned it out and created the tutorial, which meant I could just grab it and go.  Product is already done, kids are just personalizing it--no heavy explinations.

### Ways to improve

More js work that isn't just adding or removing strings.
Tell people to make sure they have chrome or firefox on their computer.
Make thimble accounts before class.
Make SDG jr account so not on my personal thimble account.
