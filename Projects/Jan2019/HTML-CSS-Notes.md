- *Week4:* [Animate.css](https://daneden.github.io/animate.css/) any other help wanted

### Ways to improve

We need to switch to a new online text editor as Mozilla is shutting down Thimble at the end of the year.  We can export all existing projects to Glitch.
Rally more volunteers to help TA--especially current students.
