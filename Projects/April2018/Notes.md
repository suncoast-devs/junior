## Location

Hosted at Gooee over 4 mondays in April 2018.

### What went well

The kids enjoyed having something they could immediately show off.
Being able to create the tutorial was really great, but unfortunately it does not update all projects already remixed.
Each week I would remix the project and walk the kids through the coding process live, but then I would udpate the original project.  This came in handy when the kids projects went so wrong we could just start them over exactly where we left off.

### Ways to improve

Typing is an issue with a lot of the younger students, providing things for them to copy and paste is much easier.  However, if there is a problem with the first thing you copy and paste then the rest will cause problems.
Explaining the rules for the higher level (throws vs bouts/matches/games etc etc etc) was much harder than explaining the code.
Provide more ways for them to just experiement like in the 2nd week when they played around with css for a lot of the class.
