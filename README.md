# README for Suncoast Deverlopers Guild Jr (SDG Jr)

This is a repo for the kids codes classes referred to as Suncoast Developers Guild Jr (SDG Jr).

We will be providing links to and the codes for our class projects here.  This is primarily for the instructors to track what we have done, what works and what doesn't work.

## How to contribute

1. Create a branch titled the month and year of the session (ie *April2018*, *Oct2017*).
2. In the *projects* directory place links to final projects and the code.
3. Any notes you wish to add can be placed in the *Notes* directory.
4. Add the branch name, project, number of classes and location to **Sessions.md** (ex. April2018 - Rock Paper Scissors - 4 weeks - Gooee)

Notes should not include any information about the students in the public repo.  Notes should include things that worked, went well, or things we found difficult explaining or what we might not do next time. Notes should also include information about sponsors and location.
