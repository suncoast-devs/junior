# README for Suncoast Deverlopers Guild Jr (SDG Jr)

This is a repo for the kids code classes referred to as Suncoast Developers Guild Jr (SDG Jr).

We will be providing links to and the code for our class projects here.  This is primarily for the instructors to track what we have done, what works and where we can improve.

## How to contribute

1. Create a branch titled the month and year of the session (ie *April2018*, *Oct2017*).
2. In the *projects* directory place links to final projects, code and notes.
3. Add the branch name, project, number of classes and location to **Sessions.md** (ex. April2018 - Rock Paper Scissors - 4 weeks - Gooee)

Notes should not include any information about the students in the public repo.  Notes should include things that worked, went well, or things we found difficult or what we might improve. Notes should also include information about sponsors and location.

Contact [LizThrilla](https://github.com/lizthrilla) for questions about SDG Jr and [suncoast-devs](https://github.com/suncoast-devs) for problems with the repo.
